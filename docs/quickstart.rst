Quickstart
==========

For installation instructions see :ref:`installation`.

Once installed, check out some of the scripts in the `examples folder`_. These
should run from any directory you put them in.

A good starting place is the single column model in `scm.py`_.

If you haven't used Sympl before, you may want to read the `Sympl documentation`_,
or at least the `Sympl quickstart`_.
